you shoot spheres / cylinders to get a high score.

enemies spawn each wave, increasing until the 5th wave 
where the boss spawns which has an increased health 
(taking 10 shots to destroy rather than 1) then
resetting the amount of enemies that spawn.

there are several powerup types that change the gameplay. 
there is a shotgun, rapid fire, piercing, and invincibility powerup 
that changes how the player progresses through the wave.
